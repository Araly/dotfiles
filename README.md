# dotfiles

Using [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3), [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar), [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi), [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal), compton, various scripts.

These dotfiles are used on the [Manjaro i3 community edition](https://manjaro.org/community-editions/) but should work on any linux distribution. Most of the dotfiles are defaults, playing and tweaking, and from [r/unixporn](reddit.com/r/unixporn).
